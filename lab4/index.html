			<h1>Lab 4 - Everyday Task + Game Pseudocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab our assignment was to pseudocode an unfamiliar everyday task and a simple computer game. Then we converted the pseudocode into comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The first problem we ran into was understanding the task we were presented with, but we also had trouble understanding how to break down the tasks logically at first. Breaking everything down into high-level tasks did help us organize a lot.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>At first I was worried this lab would be challenging but It turned out to be pretty straight forward and easy! I personally was having a rough week with my personal life, so I did not put much extra effort into the assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
