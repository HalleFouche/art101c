			<h1> Hello World</h1>
			<h2> Lab: html and css</h2>
			<p> Hi im Halle! I am a third year AGPM major with interest in UI/ UX design! My hobbies include dancing, art and design, and playing with my cats!
				I have little experience with coding and no experience with HTML, CSS, and Java so I am excited to learn more about these programs and how they 
				can be useful to me! I plan on going into marketing or something with web design where I can utilize my UI/ UX skills.

					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> In this Lab we were tasked with creating and editing with HTML and style it with CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> It was a bit tricky to learn how to navigate Visual Studio Code at first but after I was able to figure out the basics I didnt have a 
						hard time moving forward. Learning CSS was definitely the most challenging part but nothing has been over my head so far!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Reflection</h2>
					<p> I genuinely enjoyed designing with CSS. Personally, I am obsessed with aesthetics so it was super fun to experiment with different fonts,
						colors, layouts, and all the other good stuff!
					</p>
