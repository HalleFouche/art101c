			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to create links on our homepage to the labs we have done so far. This is a great way to organize all our work in one place.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, this lab was a little difficult for me to figure out, but then I realized I was just overcomplicating it. Most of my troubles stemmed from trying to make my image smaller but it kept getting bigger. I realized that the name of my photo in html did not match the name of my photo in css. I changed this and everything was the right size!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really like organizing so this lab helped me to easily access all of my work in one place! </p>
