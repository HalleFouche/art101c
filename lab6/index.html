			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The goal of this lab is to experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>This lab was definitely the hardest for me. My JavaScript was not working correctly but it did not tell me where my errors were. I also could not link JS with HTML properly at first, but I asked AI what went wrong and it informed me of the necessary corrections.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I put in extra work to understand the issues I was having and it ultimately took me a lot longer than the other labs to problem solve.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here is the JavaScript program execution:</p>
